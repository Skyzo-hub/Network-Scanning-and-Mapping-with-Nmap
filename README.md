# Network Scanning and Mapping with Nmap

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to perform network scanning and mapping using Nmap to identify devices, services, and potential vulnerabilities within a network.

### Skills Learned

- Network reconnaissance.
- Network discovery, port scanning, and understanding basic TCP/IP.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Security auditing.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Offensive and defensive network security.

### Tools Used

- Nmap (Network Mapper) for log ingestion and analysis.
- Zenmap.
- Traceroute
- Metasploit
- OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)
- Wireshark

## Steps

Use commands like nmap -A <target IP address> 192.168.18.76 for OS detection, version detection, script
scanning, and traceroute.
